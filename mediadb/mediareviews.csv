1,user_one,"I am a big fan of the animated movies coming from the Pixar Studios. They are always looking for the newest technological possibilities to use in their movies, creating movies that are more than just worth a watch, even when they were made a decade ago.

The movie is about toys that come to life when their owner is asleep or not in the same room. When the young boy's birthday is coming up, all the toys are nervous. They don't want to be ignored when the new one arrives. Woody the cowboy is their ""leader"" because he's the most popular one of them all. He's the only one that hasn't got to be afraid, but than a new favorite arrives ... Buzz Lightyear. He hates him and tries everything possible to get rid of him, but as the time passes by they learn to appreciate each other...",10
1,user007,"I saw Toy Story in theaters in 95. As a kid it was funny, and original not just in story but in presentation.

After 15 years the cg doesn't hold up in all areas. The human characters look stiff and the way background looks a bit flat. This plastic look works with toys so it doesn't become a problem.

The movie holds up in every other area. The plot is engaging and the characters funny and likable.

Toy Story is a family film it funny for children without talking down to them and enjoyable for adults.

As a twenty something year old it is just as entertaining as when I first saw the original release.",9
1,moviefan,"I saw this movie when i was 5 years old a long time ago and I was so obsessed with Buzz Lightyear! I had toys of buzz Lightyear and carried them around anywhere i went.I saw this movie yesterday again and it was fabulous! plain fabulous. The story was amazing and the characters were well made! Nice job Pixar, You done it again! Tom Hanks did well doing a voice of Woody and same with Tim Allen with Buzz. I didn't really like Wall.E i almost fell asleep but this movie kept me awake the whole time with excitement! I recommend this movie to anyone no matter what age you are because this movie Just Beautiful! An fantastic awesome 10/10",9
2,newuser,"I saw this epic last night at the Empire Leicester Sq in London, which is a superb venue in which to view this film. Huge screen, excellent sound and an extraordinary Dolby, 3 dimensional image. The whole effect is mind blowing.

This is a 'Must see' movie, innovative, and extraordinary. I think it will be regarded by most cinema goers as another milestone in the history of the art. The level of realism achieved is remarkable, and although the film is relatively long in real time, it retains it's excitement and holds the audience's attention to the end.

Performances are good, but this is not the sort of film that dwells on big star value for the actors, although Sigorney Weaver does shine and delivers a very convincing performance, as do the rest of the cast. But as there is so much entertainment and action value on screen the human element does not dominate in the usual way.

As Writer/Director, James Cameron deserves high praise for this creation and in my opinion it will break box office records. I thoroughly enjoyed this film.",10
2,anonymus,"James Cameron is one of the best directors of all time. He is what you may call an Auteur. If you aren't aware of this, then you probably are not a movie person. James Cameron wrote and directed Terminator, Aliens, Terminator 2, and Titanic. That last one I'm not a fan of, but he won Best Director, Picture, and it became the highest grossing film of all time. $1.2 billion dollars.

Avatar is his latest film, it is a movie that has been in the works since 1994. After a decade of being in the works, you would expect it to be a good movie. But the real question is it any good? It is the most expensive film ever made. The budget was $500,000,000 so you'll be wondering if all that money was put to good use, and if you should spend $11.00 to see the film in 3-D. Should you or should you not?

The answer is that you should. Avatar is a monumental success. It is a film unlike anything you have ever seen. It uses special effects to a level that you have never seen, and that's not a bad thing.

2,user1,"For all its visual proficiency, ""Avatar"" is not the apex of cinematic achievement some reviewers would have you believe it is, and the primary reason is this: the wobbly script is about as old as cinema itself -- the abundance of flat dialogue like ""You're not the only one with a gun, bitch"" doesn't help either. For this reason (and others discussed below) I still rank Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy as superior to ""Avatar"" -- Cameron's film may be technologically superior, but it lacks the intelligence and subtle emotion of Jackson's expertly crafted cinematic trio.

""Avatar"" is filled with familiar characters, from the rebellious outsider and hero Jake Scully (Sam Worthington) to noble human scientist Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) to a cartoonish villain (Stephen Lang) invoking the imperialist bloodlust of Bush Cheney Co. to the wise and peaceful Na'vi chief (Wes Studi) and shaman (C.C.H. Pounder) who happen to be parents to the Na'vi princess, Neytiri (Zoe Saldana).

3,simpleuser,Any one who read DC comics will tell you Green Arrow is a poor mans Batman so to speak... That being said. With all the copy-write garbage I am sure it is easier to get rights to make a green arrow show rather than a new batman show... This still doesn't excuse how horrible this thing is. A friend referred it to me as a great show with the Flash in it. They don't cover the Flash at all really. Just a short cameo with normal Barry Allen. I would encourage you to watch a daytime soap opera then watch this garbage and tell me the difference. The acting is horrible. The writing is so awful that it must be done by drunken monkeys. They randomly put a villain in the clock tower and Arrows crew wonders where he is. They should just move their headquarters there. If they ask Laural one more time IS SOMETHING WRONG i will punch my TV.,7
3,tvhog,"Never mind the stereotypical characters. Never mind the non-existant logic. Never mind that the dialogue is inane and bordering on idiotic. THIS IS GREAT ACTION! And there's no point in denying it.

First of all: I love to watch destruction. Preferably in larger scales. You get fed an enormous amount of it here. Second: I love alien starships the size of New York. And you sure get that too. And third: I love dogfights. You get that too. Forth: I don't take it seriously.

This films is one of the best of the decade, not simply because it works so well in an all-over scheme, but it provides some kicks that no other film had up to then (1996). Aliens arrive in gigantic spaceships and blow up a bunch of major cities. That's all I need.",10
3,purplefury,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Save yourself the time with this one unless your less than about 12 years old or have a very low IQ.

It's like the ideas been pieced together from other shows. It's stupid, inconsistent, hypocritical, ridiculous, and most of the acting is terrible.

It's a pity because the underlying story with the mother and her associates is the shows only redemption. You just have to sit through the agony of the rest of the show to get this. Maybe they should save us all the heartache and just tell us what happens with that story line.",5
4,user_one,"Independence Day is the sort of film that's best appreciated on a big screen, preferably a massive great plasma television that is so huge you had to cut the roof off your house and get airlifted in by helicopters just to get it in the living room. You should also have the most state of the art surround sound possible, with bass pickups so deep they cause earthquakes on the Eastern seaboard. Not because Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich's alien invasion flick is a masterpiece of cinematic art or anything, but because it's loud. Very loud. And if the windows in your house don't shatter when the spaceship flies over New York then well, you're just not experiencing it properly.",7

5,tango,"I have to admit that I was less than thrilled with this show's beginning. I didn't think the characters were well defined and the plot seemed very lackluster.

I did continue to watch, though, and I am glad that I did.

Each week, the characters are developing and the chemistry between the actors is getting better. The writing and the quick witted dialog are classic Joss. It just took some time to work out the kinks.

The story lines are getting tighter as the show goes on. Also, as each character develops, there are questions raised that keep me coming back each week for answers.

I'm glad that I stuck with this show and gave it a chance. It is turning out to be a great ensemble action show that I hope will last a long time.",8
5,charlie," think this is an interesting show.As with all new shows they can tweak it as they go along.I thought in the beginning it wouldn't hold my attention,since I have only watched one Avenger Movie and one Ironman Movie,but I am a fan of other Marvel comic movies.I think the spin off to television is a good idea.I like the cast. I think the cast appeals to younger and mature viewers. I really like Clark Gregg's character Coulson,he's vulnerable but strong,very sexy.I think he has all the viewers wondering what they did to him while he was allegedly dead.I hope the fans and the network give this show a chance.I believe it's worth it.",3
5,delta,"season 1 started slowly but since then it has grown into a television masterpiece leaving me every week wanting more!! The way the show is written they can change their future plans easily yet it seems what is happening in the end of season 2 was planned in detail in the beginning of season 1. The TV show is also a great way for marvel to introduce new characters try new pans and set up upcoming movies.

Marvels Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D's earlier episodes i season 1 will put many people off the show as it just seems slightly boring and pointless but sticking through those episodes you can see how every little detail in previous episodes are extremely important to the plot and the episodes near the end of season 2 were everything comes together in an excellent display of screen writing.",8
6,scorpio,"I was curious about this very hyped pilot, I like the idea and watched the pilot yesterday. I am not impressed and here is why; There is always a certain degree of imagination of course, that is not only expected but necessary- but the idea of FBI being so incredibly easy to manipulate is appalling. And the agents are portrayed as idiots. I have only seen one episode and I have already lost all respect for them. I did not like the female main character. She is way too gullible and perfectly fixed up even when she is in major danger. I thought we were passed those kind of female characters. And when story fails, because of lack of real people and a fascinating plot, add explosions, car chases and children in danger. I know it will probably pick up, James Spader is amazing in most things he does, but I will not waste any more time on this show.",5
6,lily,"ve been looking forward to James Spader's return to the small screen since Boston Legal. and just finished watching last episode at http://www.trailerdb.net as always Mr Spader has chosen well the show to return with, it is a fascinating series about a mastermind criminal turning himself in to the FBI with a list of criminals that are pulling strings all over the world, the people behind the criminals.

The termination of Dexter and Breaking bad has left very little to watch on television but I can't help but to be hopeful with such great new shows taking their places. 

I am a big fan of Mr Spader and I can't wait for the next episodes. Bravo!",10
6,rose,"I will be following this show ,because I saw the pilot recently and it impressed me and so did the next few episodes. What I did not like was the acting- Spader tries to play the mastermind nobody can touch until he wants them to,but somehow I am not convinced he fits the bill.Megan Boone looks good,but her acting is so dull .Same is the case with the supporting cast. About the show,it's definitely fresh and has that complex feel that viewers find intriguing. Overall,the show has an interesting plot and might even have many seasons ahead,but I just wish the actors get it together.The only saving grace in terms of convincing acting are Spader and the woman who plays Meera Malik -the leads could take a tip or two from her. It will be interesting to see where it goes from here. The blacklist is surely on the top of my ""watchlist"" :)",8
